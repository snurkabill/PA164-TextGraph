Microsoft released several security updates today MS05-001, MS05-002 and MS05-0.
MS05-001 has a fix for a remote code execution issue affecting the HTML Help Control&amp;#1.
MS05-002 contains a fix for the X-Focus issues&amp;#1.
MS05-003 has a fix for a remote code execution issue with Indexing Services.
The first two are rated critical and the third is important .
MS05-001 is the most critical to reducing IE-based attack vectors.
The HTML Help Control team updated the version of their control that fixes a critical vulnerability in that component.
We are glad they were able to fix this vulnerability so quickly.
Unfortunately, the XPSP2 security mitigations do not protect against the flaw in this control, so I encourage everybody to download the latest security updates from Windows Updateand if possible turn on automatic updates so you get these updates without having to navigate to Windows Update.
Microsoft also released technology on Windows Update today that helps remove malicious software from your system if it has been infected.
The Malicious Software Removal Tool is mainly targeted at consumers, but it can also be leveraged in the enterprise space via SMS.
