Hi, my name is Mike Chan, and I'm a product manager for Internet Explorer focused on businesses.
This week, we released two documents to help businesses get IE7 deployed.
The first document explains the business value of upgrading to Internet Explorer 7 for Windows XP and can help you convince your management to deploy the latest version of IE.
The second document provides detailed guidance on how to get moving on that deployment.
The IE7 Technology Overview for Businessesdescribes how improvements in IE7 will help you deploy and manage IE7 in your enterprise environment.
Whether you support a large, medium, or small business, we describe how Internet Explorer 7 can help secure your business while increasing productivity.
For those who have to deal with a few hundred or more desktops, there are additional considerations before rolling out the new browser.
As you plan your deployment, check out the Internet Explorer 7 Deployment Guide.
This guide discusses methods of deployment and maintenance, management as well as support of Internet Explorer 7 after deployment.
We're always interested in what you have to say - drop us a note at iedeploy@microsoftcomto provide feedback on these new documents.
Thanks, Mike Chan Product Manager.
