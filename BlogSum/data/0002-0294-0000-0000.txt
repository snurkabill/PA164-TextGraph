Add-ons for the IE platform are more than just toolbars, custom browsers and find-on-page add-ons.
The edges of what you can do with the platform are virtually unlimited.
Earlier this year at Mix06, Greg Reinacker and Walter VonKoch demo d a toolfor synchronizing the RSS platform state with your NewsGator online account.
On Monday, Nick Harris (no relation) at NewsGator announcedthat the tool, renamed NewsGator Desktop Sync is available for general beta.
From his post: Desktop Sync is a system tray application that keeps your feeds, folders and read states synchronized between NewsGator Online and the Windows RSS Platform.
This means that any application that uses the Windows RSS Platform will be automatically synchronized with your NewsGator Online account.
Of course, since IE7 uses the Windows RSS Platform, this is a great way to roam the feeds you read in IE from one machine to another.
Check out Nick's postfor information on where to download and where to give feedback on the tool.
Pick it up and try it out.
Be sure to check out the many other add-ons at IEAddOnscomand let us know what you think.
