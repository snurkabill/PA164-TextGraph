Hi, I'm Gary Schare and I run the product management team for IE.
This includes defining and communicating the IE value proposition for all customer segments and helping the product team with long-term product strategy.
I posted a comment last week about Windows Marketplace on the Community Site entryand wanted to follow up with more info.
Windows Marketplacewent live this week and contains an entire sectiondevoted to browser add-ons.
This section comes directly from Downloadcom so all add-ons already listed there are searchable in Marketplace.
If you haven't already noticed, IE in XP SP2 ships with a link to Marketplace in the Links folder.
So millions of users will be visiting the site very soon.
If you're a developer and want to get your new products listed there, visit the Marketplace partner site, but you have to be a member of the Microsoft Partner Program to list your products.
You can sign up right on the site.
- Gary.
