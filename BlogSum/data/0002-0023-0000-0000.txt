With XPSP2 out the door, we're turning our attention to bringing our latest security enhancements to upcoming Windows releases.
Next up: Windows Server 2003 SP1 and Windows XP 64-bit edition v2003, which are both currently in Beta.
Both these platforms will receive the same treatment as XPSP2 did for IE: they'll get all our security improvements, the pop-up blocker, the information bar, etc.
See Tony's blog entryabout IE in XPSP2 for more info links about the changes we made in XPSP2.
Customers who want to keep their Server box hardened will still be able to of course (and it will remain the default setting for any Windows Server).
Once these changes are ported to those platforms, the new SV1 UA string token will show up there too.
