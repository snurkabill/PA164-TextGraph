Earlier this week we released the latest security update for IE, MS04-038.
We've been working on this since XPSP2 shipped, and it's nice to see it made available to customers on Windows Update.
This update addresses, among other issues, the drag drop vulnerabilitythat's been in the news security circles lately.
This is also the first IE update to use the our latest installation technology, so corporations who deploy Microsoft products and updates will have a more uniform experience doing so.
Phil, some of the other IE team members, and I participated in a web chatyesterday morning to discuss this release with our corporate and end-user customers it was great to hear their feedback, concerns, and questions.
Looks like the slideswere just posted for people to take a look at in case you missed the chat.
Surf safely.
