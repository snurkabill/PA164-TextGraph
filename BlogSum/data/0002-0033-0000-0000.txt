Congratulations to the Boston Red Sox, the 2004 World Series Champions.
It is amazing to think that they not only won the World Series for the first time since 1918, but they did it in extraordinary fashion, winning 8 straight games against two of the best teams in baseball.
Before I started working with a VIC-20 or a Commodore 64, I was a baseball fanatic.
I grew up in New England (Vermont to be exact) living and dying with the fate of the Red Sox.
I was fortunate enough to see them play a number of games, cheer for them during the 1975 World Series (they lost to the Cincinnati Reds in seven games), and have my childhood dreams broken by Bucky Dent's home run in the one game playoff in 1978.
The Bill Buckner ground ball in the 1986 World Series only served to remind me of the disappointment of my childhood.
Now these memories are all the more wonderfully bittersweet with their World Series winning victory last night.
Scott.
